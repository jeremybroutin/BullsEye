# BullsEye
Guessing game with two options: guess the slider value, or guess the slider placement to match a particular value.  
This project covers Unit and UI testing:
- creating a unit test target
- using XCTAsserts to test model
- faking objects and interactions (here with UserDefaults)
- ui testing in Xcode (recording interactions with the UI)

Additional UI customization was brought to the default project provided by the tutorial.
